# TTGO-WiFiSwitch
This is a mashup of two example sketches in the Arduino IDE: WiFiAccessPoint and All_Free_Fonts_Demo.

I combined the two and modified the sketch in a way that the accesspoint acts as a web server offering three options: RUN, STOP, or RESET the TTGO T-Display board. I wanted the option to start over if needed, so resetting is important for my project. The display is updated with the current status. This example sketch is something I will be working with as I go forward in putting the TTGO T-Watch 2020 on board a rocket to record motion over time.
